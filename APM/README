Introduction
============

The goal of apm.py is providing of an uniform and platform
independent interface to APM. At the moment it implements only
battery relevant functions. The interface is not stable yet.

Because I don't have dozens of laptops and operating systems
I need help! It would be great to have a Python modul which
covers APM more or less completely for many platforms one day.


Usage of apm.py
===============

Usage is simple. Do something like the following:

import apm
battery = apm.Apm()

...

battery.update()
print battery.percent()
print battery.time()
print battery.charging_state()



Note that you have to call update() if you want get the current
state of battery. Note furthermore that apm raises exceptions in 
some cases. Please take a look into the short and well readable
source file apm.py.
