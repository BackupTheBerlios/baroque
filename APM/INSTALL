Linux 2.4:

The Linux implementation reads informations from /proc/apm.
Therefore a low level modul is not needed. Copy the file
apm.py from the apm.py directory into your Python 
directory/site-packages (in most cases you must be root for 
that). That's all.


NetBSD 1.6 / FreeBSD 4 / Mac OS X:

You need two modules: apm.py and apm_lowlevel.py. In most cases 
you must be root for the next steps. 
Installation of apm.py is very simple. Copy the file apm.py from 
the apm.py directory into your Python directory/site-packages. 
For installation of apm_lowlevel.py do the following:

python setup.py install

That's all.
