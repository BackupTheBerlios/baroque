changes from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0:

2003-08-18 Tilo Riemer <riemer@lincvs.org>

	* fixed (Linux): some systems (for instance MDK 9.1) are 
	identified as linux instead of linux2; a workaround is 
	added but it will not work for Linux < 2.x ;-)

2003-04-30 Tilo Riemer <riemer@lincvs.org>

	* added: support for FreeBSD 4 and OpenBSD
	* fixed: NetBSD: charging state
