Introduction
============

The goal of acpi.py is providing of an uniform and platform
independent interface to ACPI. The interface is not stable yet.

Because I don't have dozens of laptops and operating systems
I need help! It would be great to have a Python modul which
covers ACPI more or less completely for many platforms one day.


Usage of acpi.py
===============

Usage is simple. Do something like the following:

import acpi
battery = acpi.Acpi()

...

battery.update()
print battery.percent()
print battery.capacity()
print battery.nb_of_batteries()
print battery.charging_state()



Note that you have to call update() if you want get the current
state of battery. Note furthermore that acpi raises exceptions in 
some cases. Please take a look into the short and well readable
source file acpi.py.
