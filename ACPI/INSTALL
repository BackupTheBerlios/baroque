Linux 2.4:

The Linux implementation reads informations from /proc/acpi/battery.
Therefore a low level modul is not needed. Copy the file
acpi.py from the acpi.py directory into your Python 
directory/site-packages (in most cases you must be root for 
that). 
Be sure that the desired ACPI drivers are loaded (you will have
/proc/acpi/* directories)
That's all.
