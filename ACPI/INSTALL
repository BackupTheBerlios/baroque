INSTALL

Linux 2.4:

The Linux implementation reads informations from /proc/acpi/battery.
Therefore a low level modul is not needed. Copy the file
acpi.py from the acpi.py directory into your Python 
directory/site-packages (in most cases you must be root for 
that). 
Be sure that the ACPI battery driver is loaded (you will have a
/proc/acpi/battery directory)
That's all.

This version is tested with SuSE 8.1 and Linux 2.4.19.
