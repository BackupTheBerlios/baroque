							In the early 1800s, applets were fattened for their rich, meaty taste and pleasing texture. Today, they grow solely to be more visible on your panel. This value determines how wide your applet appears, and if used on vertical panels, they will widen to accommodate if it not already wide enough.

				    		If you do, it will no longer have a running display of battery info under the meter, but will rather place it inside. This saves vertical space, so if you run a horizontal panel and want to save space, this is the time to do it.
