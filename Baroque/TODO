The applet should read the current panel size and adjust itself to it automatically.
MASSIVE code cleanup. Make everything objects.
	... No, no, trust me, it'll be cool.
Add credits dialog ;)
Clean up the menu. Should have a "root' header for appname, and option. See if we can possibly grab the panel's menu as well.
Clean up the apm/acpi stuffs. This should NOT be getting taken care of in the boxes class, but rather in some wrapper for the battery API loading.
Clean up init in AppletRun.

Minor fixes needed:
Massive pruning in options. ;)
